# About ZSAnimator

ZSAnimator is a set of scripts made for both GZDoom and Blender to allow you to animate weapons in Blender and export them directly to GZDoom.
This repository thus contains a set of scripts. One of them is export_zsa.py, the other is zsanimator.zs. The former is the Blender plugin, the latter the script for GZDoom.

## Blender
export_zsa.py is the plugin you load into Blender. This gives you the option to export an armature's animation data to ZScript.

## ZScript
zsanimator.zs is what you #include in your doom mod to allow it to run the animations you make with the Blender plugin.

For the time being I only have this unscripted 45 minute Youtube video where I mess around a bit too much. It does show you how ZSAnimator works, but I need to refine this video in the near future.
